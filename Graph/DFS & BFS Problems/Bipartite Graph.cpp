// Bipartite is used in recommedation systems - An edge between a user and a movie indicates that the user has watched or rated the movie. The system can use this bipartite graph to recommend new movies to users by analyzing similar usersâ€™ watch history

// One set of nodes represents job seekers, and the other set represents job openings. Edges between them indicate that a candidate is qualified or has applied for a specific job. Algorithms can be used on this bipartite graph to match candidates with suitable jobs.
